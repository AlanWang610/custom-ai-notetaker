# Security Guide - API Key Management

## 🔐 **Secure API Key Storage**

This project uses a `.env` file to securely store your OpenAI API key locally, preventing accidental exposure in version control.

### ✅ **What's Been Set Up For You**

1. **`.env` file**: Contains your actual API key (automatically ignored by git)
2. **`.env.example`**: Template file (safe to commit to git)
3. **`.gitignore`**: Configured to ignore all environment files
4. **Code integration**: Automatically loads API key from `.env` file

### 🛡️ **Security Features**

#### **Git Protection**
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` - will never be committed
- ✅ `.env.local`, `.env.production` also ignored
- ✅ `*.key` files ignored for additional security

#### **File Location**
- ✅ `.env` file stays in project root (not in subdirectories)
- ✅ Only accessible to your local system
- ✅ Not deployed or shared accidentally

#### **Automatic Loading**
- ✅ Code automatically loads `.env` on startup
- ✅ Falls back to system environment variables if needed
- ✅ Clear error messages if API key is missing

## ⚠️ **Security Best Practices**

### **DO:**
- ✅ Keep `.env` file in project root only
- ✅ Use different API keys for different projects
- ✅ Rotate API keys periodically
- ✅ Monitor OpenAI usage dashboard for unexpected activity
- ✅ Use `.env.example` template for sharing project setup

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Never commit `.env` file to git
- ❌ Don't share `.env` file in emails/messages
- ❌ Don't store API keys in source code directly
- ❌ Don't use the same API key across multiple machines/users
- ❌ Don't ignore API key security warnings

## 🔍 **Verify Security**

Check that your setup is secure:

```powershell
# 1. Verify .env is ignored by git
git status
# Should NOT show .env as a tracked file

# 2. Check .env file exists and has your key
Get-Content .env
# Should show your API key

# 3. Verify .env.example is safe (no real key)
Get-Content .env.example
# Should show placeholder text
```

## 🚨 **If API Key is Compromised**

If you accidentally expose your API key:

1. **Immediately revoke** the key at [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Generate a new key** in your OpenAI account
3. **Update `.env`** file with the new key
4. **Check usage** in OpenAI dashboard for unauthorized activity
5. **Review git history** to ensure key wasn't committed

## 🔄 **Sharing the Project**

When sharing this project with others:

1. **Share the repository** (`.env` will automatically be excluded)
2. **Recipients should**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add their own OpenAI API key to `.env`
   - Never commit their `.env` file

## 📁 **File Permissions**

For additional security (Linux/macOS):
```bash
# Make .env readable only by owner
chmod 600 .env

# Verify permissions
ls -la .env
# Should show: -rw------- (owner read/write only)
```

## 🎯 **Why This Approach**

1. **Security**: API keys never enter version control
2. **Convenience**: No need to set environment variables manually
3. **Portability**: Easy to move between development environments
4. **Team-friendly**: Each developer uses their own API key
5. **Production-ready**: Same pattern works for deployment

## ✅ **Security Checklist**

- [x] `.env` file created with your API key
- [x] `.env` added to `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.example` template created for sharing
- [x] Code loads API key automatically from `.env`
- [x] Git will ignore `.env` file in commits
- [x] Clear error messages if API key missing

Your API key is now securely stored and automatically loaded! 🔐

**Remember**: The `.env` file is your personal copy - never share it or commit it to version control!
